I used the framework given by udacity for this project and used code from the lessons for this one.

Furthermore I commented my code, especially the core kalman-functions.

src: The C++-code for the project

build: In the directory is the ExtendedKF-executable (can be run with ./ExtendedKF path/to/input.txt path/to/output.txt) and the *.cbp project data (I used codeblocks for this project)

data: Booth input and output-files can be found here. output for the first measurement data and output2 for the second one.

For the next project I will try to go a bit deeper and get a tad more creatively with my solution.

I hope everything works as expected.

P.S: If it is required - like back in Term 1 - to make a whole readme.md-file for this project just message me back - I was not sure, because there is not much images-examples I could use there and the commentary in the code should explain everything, I would suppose.

Thanks for the review and have a nice weekend. :)

Greetings Frank
